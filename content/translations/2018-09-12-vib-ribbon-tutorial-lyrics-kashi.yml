general-notes:
  - transcribed and translated by me (raehik)
  - the game uses katakana only -- I transcribed it into medium-high kanji heavy
  - the official translation may be better and worse in places. e.g. perhaps the
    "Xs are Y" should be "Press Y for Xs"
  - wanted to write "hit" instead of "press" but they always use 押す so I
    figured I should be consistent too, and it doesn't sound really non-casual
  - pretty sure I translated the "can"s properly (飛べる etc.)

      ビブリボンは
      音から生まれた「ピース」に合わせて正しいボタンを押すゲームなんだ
    translation: |
      That was close!  
      Vib Ribbon is a game where  
      You press the correct buttons in time with "pieces" made from the music
    notes:
      - "Vib Ribbon is a game where": tricky bit, mostly good as long as sounds
        good in English to others

      でも　戻れるよー！  
      ビブリボンは４つのボタンしか使わないよ  
      簡単簡単
    translation: |
      But don't worry, you can get back to normal!  
      Vib Ribbon only uses 4 buttons --  
      Easy peasy!
    notes:
      - "But don't worry": added in "don't worry", think it's better in EN, but
        now the line is too long
      - Wanted to say "Simple and clean!" for 簡単簡単 lol

      Plenty more to come!

      ちょっと待って！
    translation: |
      Oh?  
      What's this piece?  
      Hold on a second!
    notes:
      - "Oh? What's this piece?" ありゃりゃ can't think of better EN than "oh"

      You press L and (down) at the same time  
      L and (down)
